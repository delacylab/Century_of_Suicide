# Code for "A century of suicide: New insights from long term data in the United States" by de Lacy et al.

This public repository stores the Python code used to compute the aggregate statistics reported in the paper. 

# Data Sources

The three data sources used to generate the Suicide Trends and Archival Comparative Knowledgebase (STACK) used in the paper are:

(1) Summary vital statistics data from annual reports (1900-1968) available on the National Center Health Statistics (NCHS) website. See https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus.htm. 

(2) Approved, restricted, de-identified, and individual-level death certificate data obtained from Detailed Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) files provided by NCHS for deaths from 1968 to 2021. See https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/detailed-mortality-file-description.pdf.

(3) Population denominator counts for calendar year-sex-race-county-specific single-year age groups obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program that curates and distributes these US Census data. See https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata.
